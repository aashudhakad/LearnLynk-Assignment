To implement Stripe Checkout, I would create a backend endpoint that initializes a Checkout Session using stripe.checkout.sessions.create, passing the application ID as client_reference_id and the fee amount. Before redirecting the user, I would insert a record into a payment_requests table (linking the session_id to the application_id) with a status of "pending" to track the initiation.

I would then set up a secure webhook endpoint to listen for the checkout.session.completed event, ensuring the request comes from Stripe. When this event fires, I would verify the signature, find the corresponding payment_request by session ID, and update its status to "paid". Finally, within the same webhook transaction, I would update the applications table to move the application stage to "under_review" or append a "Fee Paid" event to the application timeline.
